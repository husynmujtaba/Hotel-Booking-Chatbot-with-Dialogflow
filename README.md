# Hotel-Booking-Chatbot-with-Dialogflow

## Abstract

Booking hotels online has become a common practice, but there's always room for improvement in terms of user-friendliness and security. In this project, we introduce an AI-based hotel reservation chatbot that offers a user-friendly and secure booking experience. Users interact with the chatbot through natural language, making the booking process easier and more intuitive. The chatbot, named "HotRes Bot," is integrated with Telegram for convenient interactions. It gathers relevant information, securely handles transactions, and provides AI-based suggestions to enhance the user experience.

## Introduction

A chatbot, short for a chat robot, is a technology that enables a computer program to communicate with users through natural language, such as English. This technology has evolved significantly since its inception in 1966 with the creation of the first chatbot, Eliza, at MIT AI Laboratory. Today's chatbots, also known as artificial conversational entities (ACE), leverage advanced technologies like voice interaction and machine learning to accomplish complex tasks.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of chatbots is to support and scale business teams in their interactions with customers. They can be integrated into major chat applications such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, and text messages. Chatbots aim to make interactions more accessible, handle large capacities, provide flexibility, enhance customer satisfaction, reduce costs, expedite onboarding, automate tasks, serve as an alternate sales channel, and act as personal assistants.

## Applications of Chatbots in Business

1. Accessible anytime
2. Handling Capacity
3. Flexible attribute
4. Customer Satisfaction
5. Cost Effective
6. Faster Onboarding
7. Work Automation
8. Alternate sales channel
9. Personal Assistant

## Existing System

We conducted a survey of various chatbot implementation techniques in the existing system. Chatbots are gaining popularity, especially in the business sector, as they can automate customer service and reduce human efforts. For a chatbot to emulate human dialogue successfully, it must analyze user input correctly and formulate relevant responses. The existing system serves as the foundation for our proposed hotel reservation chatbot.

## Proposed System

Our hotel reservation chatbot, named HotRes Bot, is a unique AI-powered bot designed to instantly book hotel rooms. Users can interact with the chatbot through Telegram, making it convenient to book rooms from anywhere. The bot, integrated with Firebase for data storage, asks users necessary questions to facilitate the booking process. It stores booking information securely, allowing users to access their details anytime. The proposed system simplifies the booking process, offering benefits such as easier interaction, real-time booking status checks, time-saving bookings, reliability, and the elimination of middlemen.

## Key Benefits

- Easier interaction for booking
- Check booking status anytime
- Faster and time-saving booking process
- Reliable transactions
- No need for middlemen
